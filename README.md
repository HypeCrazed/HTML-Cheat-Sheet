# HTML Cheat Sheet
## This is NOT finished!
This is a repository containing most of the key components of HTML.

I made this mainly for myself, but feel free to use this as a guide or reference for your code.

You can find the cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/HypeCrazed/HTML-Cheat-Sheet/blob/main/HTML%20Cheat%20Sheet.html)
